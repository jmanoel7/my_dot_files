Blue Glass XCursors 3D 

Modeled, animated and rendered with Blender - http://www.blender3d.org .


Installation:

Copy the two folders 'Blue' and 'default' to your ~/.icons directory and 
restart your X-Server.

If you want to have bigger cursors, you have to create or edit the file 
.Xdefaults in your home directory and insert the following two lines:

Xcursor.theme: Blue
Xcursor.size: 48

The default size is 32. 

That's it!

Note: If the animations are flickering on your nvidia card with the latest
driver, add the following line to your XF86Config file, into the nvidia 
device section, to fix it:

Option "HWCursor" "off"

Thanks to uga for his Xcursors howto.
